# bars-patcher

This fork of the project is just to provide stnadalone executables instead of needing the online tool.

**There is now a new and improved version of this tool, the [automatic BARS patcher](https://github.com/ic-scm/automatic-bars-patcher).**

Simple BARS file patcher for patching BWAV headers with a custom file header

Compile with standard C++ compiler without any special flag

Running the program without any arguments will show help
